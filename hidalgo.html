									<h2>Hidalgo</h2>
									<p>Indie cozy narrative-adventure game</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									Hidalgo is an indie cozy narrative-adventure game based on the popular novel "Don Quijote de la Mancha". This
									reinterpretation of the book transforms the characters into puppets inside a play made by a mother for her kids.
									The mother narrates the passages of Don Quijote with a few fun twists, but the players will also experiment a
									story about the relationship of the mother with her children and how her busy life affects them.
								</p>
								<p>
									These layers define what Hidalgo is. In one hand, it is about the silly adventures that Don Quijote and Sancho
									Panza have, full of colorful landscapes, funny gimmicks and simple puzzles; but sometimes the meta layer comes
									into play in the form of meta puzzles that use the environment and the plastic nature of the maquet or a
									story about the importance of family.

										<h3>Making Hidalgo</h3>
									</header>
									<p>
										My role in Hidalgo is a generalist Game Designer. I work on every aspect of the game, ranging from the levels,
										the puzzles, the narrative or mechanics. I also focus on creating documentation both for my colleagues, to clear
										up ideas or better convince them of a new one; and for the stakeholders, to create confidance in the product.
									</p>
									<p>
										Designing new concepts for Hidalgo is a wonderful challenge. Each chapter is composed of a series of passages
										from the original work, Don Quijote de la Mancha, so whenever I work in a new section I have to read that passage
										to extract information. I focus on the main elements of that story, both the environment and story beats. I think
										of a way to transform them into a level and then give it a fun twist that utilizes the plasticity of the maquet.
