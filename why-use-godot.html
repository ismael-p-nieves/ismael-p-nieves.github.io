				    <p>The first step in every <b>Game Dev's career</b> is to stalk their favourite company's web page searching for an entry-level position with 0 years of experience needed.
						Then, after realizing that they actually have to do something in order to work in the industry, the real first step is to choose a <b>Game Engine</b> to spend whole
						afternoons working with and crying over it.
						
						Whether they already have programming skills or they have to start from the beginning, choosing a Game Engine is a big task for a Game Dev. People have many <b>reasons</b>
						for choosing one over others, like having experience with the programming language, a friend or influencer recommending it or because their favourite game was made
						with it. In this post, I'm going to get through the reasons why I chose <b>Godot</b> for my personal projects.
					</p>
				    
					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Cross-Language Scripting</h3>
					<p>The first thing that caught my attention about <b>Godot</b> is how <b>cross-language friendly</b> it is. By doing some black magic, you can essentially do that in every Game Engine,
						but the fact that Godot actually promotes it peaked my curiosity. Thanks to my <b>Computer Science degree</b>, I can work with every language that Godot officially supports
						and interchange them as convenient.
					</p>
					<p>
						I want to work with a high-level programming language for most of my scripts to agilize the process and improve the readability, while also having the option of changing
						to a lower-level language to implement some resource-heavy algorithm or subroutine. I know I won't be making any of that in the near future, but knowing that I can
						gives me the <b>freedom and confidance</b> I need to embark on new projects.
					</p>
					<img class="img-fluid" src="images/why-use-godot/godot-cross-scripting.jpg" alt="image">

					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">GDScript</h3>
					<p>Talking about programming languages, I have to say that I have completely fallen in love with <b>GDScript</b>. My go-to programming language for almost any kind of project
						has always been <b>Python</b> due to its simplicity. GDScript has a lot of similarities with Python, such as the <b>dynamic typing</b>, <b>use of indentations</b>
						and general philosophy; while being influenced by other languages such as <b>C#</b> in things like its use of <b>decorators</b> and <b>Object-Oriented programming</b>.
					</p>
					<p>
						In my full-time job I mostly use <b>C#</b> so I am used to it, and I have studied and utilized the advantages of <b>C++</b>. But I will keep using <b>GDScript</b> for now because by the
						time I write all the necessary keywords, parenthesis and brackets to declare a simple array in C#, in GDScript I've already made a for loop that iterates over that
						array to apply an algorithm to every element in a legible way.
					</p>
					<img class="img-fluid" src="images/why-use-godot/godot-python.jpg" alt="image">

					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Signals</h3>
					<p>When I first learnt about <b>signals</b>, I thought that it was going to be the hardest thing to learn; but after using them, now I want every programming language to have
						something like it due to how organic it feels to use. Following a <b>Publisher-Subscriber pattern</b>, connecting and emiting signals makes so much sense. When an event 
						happens, you simply emit the signal and every node connected to it reacts accordingly.
					</p>
					<p>
						I can see signals becoming really messy in medium to large projects because you have to remember which signals you have connected via code or the UI as well as to which
						methods are connected to, but it probably becomes a lot easier to maintain if you keep record in a <b>diagram</b>. Remember to use diagrams alongside the documentation to improve
						the readability, folks.
					</p>
					<img class="img-fluid" src="images/why-use-godot/godot-signals.jpg" alt="image">

					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">UI and IDE</h3>
					<p><b>Godot</b> is actually not my first Game Engine, it was <b>Unity</b>. I had been using it for some years from time to time, and I actually did a project for college using it. But due to
						<b>Unity's fiasco</b> with its terms and conditions last year plus some issues I had working with it, I wanted to migrate to other Game Engine for my professional career. However,
						one thing that I liked about Unity was its <b>UI</b>, and Godot's is almost identical, if not better in some ways. Being able to seamlessly change between nodes and modifying their
						attributes is something I appreciate.
					</p>
					<p>
						Plus, I really like that the <b>IDE</b> is integrated withing Godot's UI. I despise Visual Studio which was the default option for Unity, and while I like working in VS Code and
						appreciate how customizable it is, I prefer the simplicity of having the IDE inside the UI. No reloads needed, no waiting for the application to open, no need to install
						additioanl plugins... But by far the best thing about it is how seamless <b>debugging</b> is. You simply put the breakpoint in the code and start the game. That's it.
					</p>

					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Honorable Mentions</h3>
					<ul class="mb-5">
						<li class="mb-2"><b>TileMaps and Terrains</b>. I really like how they are implemented and, even though creating a Terrain can be cumbersome, it is worth the efforts to use them.
						</li>
						<li class="mb-2"><b>is_on_floor() actually works</b>. I've always despised Unity for not having a simple way of implementing such a simple thing like checking if your character is
							grounded. Instead of using RayCasts and messing up the implementation, in Godot I can simply use is_on_floor inside an if statement and forget about it.
						</li>
						<li class="mb-2"><b>Easy to use decorators</b>. I have already said before that I appreciate GDScript's simplicity, but I really noticed it by using the @ decorators, such as export
							or onready. It feels easier from having to type [SerializedField] in Unity.
						</li>
						<li class="mb-2"><b>Good ethics</b>. Unity's fiasco with its terms and conditions where the last straw to abandon it, and seeing Godot's company having good work ethics and seemingly
							caring about indie game devs is reassuring, at least for now.
						</li>
						<li class="mb-2"><b>Games in the market</b>. There have already been released some games with commercial success made in Godot like Cassette Beasts or Brotato, so knowing that it is
							possible to create a medium project with Godot is a nice thing to know.
						</li>
						<li class="mb-2"><b>My colleagues at Atomic Ferry also like it</b>. I proposed learning Godot to Atomic Ferry even though a couple of us had already used Unity, and after a month
							of learning, all of them liked it and wanted to work with it. It is important to have a Game Engine that the entire team likes to use.
						</li>
					  </ul>
				    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-3"></h3>
					<img class="img-fluid" src="images/why-use-godot/cassette-beasts-key-art.jpg" alt="image">

					<h3 class="mt-5 mb-3">Conclusions</h3>
					<p><b>Godot</b> is still a relatively new Game Engine, but it has already formed a big enough following of people using it that it doesn't feel that way. With the amount of resources
						available online, new and old indie devs developing games with Godot and overall simplicity, me and the rest of my colleagues will be using Godot for a good while.
